# Welcome to VectorMaster!

VectorMaster is a vector graphics engine that allows you to create and run vector-based programs. I made this with Python and Pygame. In the universe for my Snapverse games, VectorMaster is a desktop computer, and a predecessor to the AntiAuto.

## Features

### Engine Features
- Vector-based graphics rendering system
- Resizable display window
- Built-in audio synthesis capabilities
- Custom VectorPy scripting language (Python-like syntax)
- File browser interface

### Graphics Capabilities
- Vector line drawing
- Dot plotting
- Text rendering with custom vector font
- Screen clearing and updating
- Coordinate system with origin at center (512x512 resolution)

### Audio System
- 2 sound channels (0-1)
- 16 waveform types (17 for noise on channel 1)
- 4-bit volume (0-15)
- Frequency control (20-1600 Hz)

### Demo Programs
- **Starfield**: Dynamic star field simulation with trailing effects
- **Lines**: Interactive line-based noise pattern generator
- **Dots**: Random dot pattern generator with connecting lines
- **Waveform**: Interactive audio waveform editor and visualizer
- **Elite Demo**: 3D wireframe planet renderer with camera controls
- **Toby Fox**: Undertale/Deltarune-style battle system demo
- **Music**: A test script for playing music

### Input Handling
- Keyboard input support
- Event-based input processing
- Window resize handling
- Program exit controls
