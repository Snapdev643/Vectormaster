# Welcome to VectorMaster!

VectorMaster is a vector graphics engine that allows you to create and run vector-based programs. I made this with Python and Pygame.

## Features

### Engine Features
- Vector-based graphics rendering system
- Resizable display window
- Built-in audio synthesis capabilities
- Custom VectorPy scripting language (Python-like syntax)
- File browser interface

### Graphics Capabilities
- Vector line drawing
- Dot plotting
- Text rendering with custom vector font
- Screen clearing and updating
- Coordinate system with origin at center (512x512 resolution)

### Audio System
- 2 sound channels (0-1)
- 16 waveform types (17 for noise)
- 4-bit volume (0-15)
- Frequency control (20-1600 Hz)

### Demo Programs
- **Starfield**: Dynamic star field simulation with trailing effects
- **Lines**: Interactive line-based noise pattern generator
- **Dots**: Random dot pattern generator with connecting lines
- **Waveform**: Interactive audio waveform editor and visualizer
- **Elite Demo**: 3D wireframe planet renderer with camera controls
- **Toby Fox**: Undertale/Deltarune-style battle system demo
- **Music**: A test script for playing music

### Input Handling
- Keyboard input support
- Event-based input processing
- Window resize handling
- Program exit controls

## Getting Started

1. Run the main program to launch VectorMaster
2. Use the built-in file browser to navigate through available demos
3. Select a demo using the arrow keys and Enter
4. Press Ctrl+B to exit any running program
5. Use Escape to navigate back or exit the file browser

## Creating Programs

VectorMaster uses VectorPy, a Python-like language for creating vector graphics programs. Key features include:

- Simple import system (`import main`, `import screen`, etc.)
- Direct access to vector drawing functions
- Built-in audio synthesis
- Event handling system
- Automatic code parsing and execution

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Navigate menus and control demos
- Enter: Select/Confirm
- Escape: Back/Exit
- Ctrl+B: Force quit running program
- Space: Reset/Restart (in supported demos)
